# Text-deduplication
With a twiter dataset took on kaggle , and using unsupervised learning techniques, we identify duplicates or duplicated parts of a corpus.

EDA; identification of (near-)duplicates; deduplication of common segments; construction of a topic model of our choice;
name some topics; visualization (e.g. word clouds, dendrogram, );

 Use of BERT-like / sentence embeddings; do comprehensive text cleaning;  output top-10 most frequent words and bigrams per topic in case of clustering method; 
output topic probabilities per post in case of LDA; Do parameter selection and explain; Name obtained topics; EDA of your outputs â€“ topic sizing, charts, statistics.
